This was a quick internal tool that I threw together because the same need to cut images into pieces kept coming up for some reason.

For a lot of workshops there were ideas based around slicing an image into various pieces, which is what this quick little tool will do (mostly) for you, in a relatively easy to use format.

Just upload the image you want to split into pieces, then click the axe button (for some reason you need to do it twice), and then the image will appear as three strips. Simply right click each of them and save your images.
