This was a little test put together to help with testing BrailleConverter.js partway through development.

The fields were hastily copied off of the original java applet and no time or care had been put into the CSS at this time.

There are a fair few issues, especially with the handling of dictionaries.

For usage of grade 1 though, open the index.html file in your browser, and upload "brlApplet1.txt" as the grade 1 dictionary, then click "get new word".

In the very top field some braille characters will appear.

You are supposed to enter the correct transcription of the braille from the top field into the "User Guess" field and then press "Check Guess".
